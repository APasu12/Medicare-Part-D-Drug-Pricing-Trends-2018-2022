# Medicare Part D Drug Pricing Trends (2018-2022)
Medicare Part D is a subsidized federal program offered through private insurance companies that supports Americans aged 65+ and enrolled in Medicare to cover the cost of prescription drugs. The goal of this project is to identify key factors and relationships that are relevant to understanding drug pricing trends between 2018 and 2022.
